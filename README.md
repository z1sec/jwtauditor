## 🚀 What is JWTAuditor?

JWTAuditor is a comprehensive, **100% client-side** JWT (JSON Web Token) security testing platform designed by penetration testers, for penetration testers. Born out of real-world frustrations with existing tools, JWTAuditor provides everything you need to audit JWT implementations without compromising your data privacy.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Advanced Security Analysis** - Automated vulnerability detection with detailed explanations
- ⚡ **Secret Bruteforcing** - Test against common secrets and custom wordlists
- ✏️ **JWT Editor** - Modify tokens with support for various signing algorithms
- 🔧 **JWT Generator** - Create tokens from scratch with RSA key generation
- 🎯 **Advanced Attack Platform** - 7 specialized attack modules for comprehensive testing
- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation** - Learn JWT security with our detailed guides
- 🔒 **100% Client-Side** - Your tokens never leave your browser
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Optimized for all devices and screen sizes

## 🎯 Why JWTAuditor?

### The Problem We Solved
During penetration testing engagements, we constantly encountered JWT tokens but struggled with:
- Complex tools requiring server-side processing
- Inconsistent tooling across different environments  
- Privacy concerns with online JWT tools
- Limited vulnerability detection capabilities
- Poor documentation and learning resources
